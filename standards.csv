NIST NFIQ 1 and 2 (version 1 and version2) (NFIQ 2 is included as part of ISO/IEC 29794-4 ),,NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) allows for the standardization needed to support a worldwide deployment of fingerprint sensors with universally interpretable image qualities formally standardized as part of ISO/IEC 29794-4. NFIQ 2  a is open source software that links image quality of optical and ink 500 PPI fingerprints to operational recognition performance and serves as a reference implementation of the I ISO/IEC 29794-4 standard . NFIQ 1 ( the prior version) had quality range from 1 to 5 with 1 being the best quality where as NFIQ 2 has a range from 0 to 100 with 0 as image of no value and 100 is of  highest quality.  ,Version 2 New since standards catalogue 2018,Technical advice,Mandiory,Fingerprint,https://www.iso.org/standard/52946.html

INCITS/ISO/IEC 24708:2008,2008,"Specifies the syntax, semantics, and encodings of a set of messages (BIP messages) that enable a BioAPI-conforming application to request biometric operations in BioAPI-conforming biometric service providers (BSPs) across node or process boundaries, and to be notified of events originating in those remote BSPs. It also specifies extensions to the architecture and behaviour of the BioAPI framework that supports the creation, processing, sending and reception of BIP messages. It is applicable to all distributed applications",Updated to version 2008,Technical (Data Format),,All,https://www.iso.org/standard/52946.html
INCITS/ISO/IEC 29164:2011[R2018] ,Revised in 2018,"Provides a standard interface to hardware biometric modules designed to be integrated in embedded systems which can be constrained in memory and computational power. It specifies a full interface for such hardware-based biometric modules. This interface, called Embedded BioAPI, is defined by the specification of commands to be implemented by these modules.",Updated to version 2011,Technical (API),,All,https://www.iso.org/standard/52946.html
INCITS/ISO/IEC 29141:2009[R2015],Revised in 2015,"Specifies requirements for the use of ISO/IEC 19784-1, as amended by ISO/IEC 19784-1/Amd. 1 (BioAPI) for the purpose of performing a tenprint capture operation. Specifies a BDB format that is used to interact with a BioAPI framework (and hence with BSPs) to support an application wishing to perform a tenprint capture. Specifies a capture control block and a capture output block that conforming BSPs are required to support if they conform to this Standard.",Updated to version 2009,Technical (API),,All,https://www.iso.org/standard/52946.html
