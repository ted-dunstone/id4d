NIST NFIQ 1 and 2 (version 1 and version2) (NFIQ 2 is included as part of ISO/IEC 29794-4 ),,NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) allows for the standardization needed to support a worldwide deployment of fingerprint sensors with universally interpretable image qualities formally standardized as part of ISO/IEC 29794-4. NFIQ 2  a is open source software that links image quality of optical and ink 500 PPI fingerprints to operational recognition performance and serves as a reference implementation of the I ISO/IEC 29794-4 standard . NFIQ 1 ( the prior version) had quality range from 1 to 5 with 1 being the best quality where as NFIQ 2 has a range from 0 to 100 with 0 as image of no value and 100 is of  highest quality.  ,Version 2 New since standards catalogue 2018,Technical advice,Mandiory,Fingerprint
